    "Consider an airline that has demand for baggage handlers in a domestic airport. THe hourly requrements for 24 hours starting from midnight are 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 11, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 16, 10, 7 and 5 respectively. There are 6 shifts for handlers: the first shift may start at midnight, at 1AM, at 2AM or at 3AM. If the first shift started at hour $H$, the next shifts start at $H + 4$, $H + 8$, $H + 12$, $H + 16$ and $H + 20$. Each shift works for 9 consecutive hours. The demand is the same for all days. Using an integer programming model find the minimum number of handlers required that meets the demand and hour at which the first shift should start so that this minimum number of handlers is minimized."
